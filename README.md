# Simple Pytorch Neural Network
This repository is a collection of simple pytorch neural network, possibly of various type.<br>
Most of the program has the same pattern, and carefully annotated for enjoyable learning.<br>
However, this repository is not perfect, and I would really appreciate if you want to give me some feedback.<br>
Pull request is definitely welcomed.
